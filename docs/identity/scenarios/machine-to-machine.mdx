# Machine to Machine

You can use OAuth 2.0 to call one API from another one and secure the connection between those two. For this scenario, we can use the **Client Credentials Flow**.

The Client Credentials Flow uses a client's ID and Secret to request an Access Token from the identity service. As this flow is only executed in the backend and by clients that can hold secrets, we can create a client that has a secret for this flow.

The following scenarios should use the Machine to Machine setup:

- A service running on server is calling another API
- An IoT client with no user interface is calling an API

## Create a client

Each API or service that wants to call another one gets represented by its own client. To create a client for Machine to Machine communication, you can run the following command.

```bash
curl --request POST 'http://<ADMIN_ENDPOINT>/client' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
  "audience": [ "https://localhost:5001/" ],
  "grant_types": [ "client_credentials" ],
  "response_types": [ "token" ],
  "scope": "read:secrets",
  "client_type": "machine_to_machine"
}'
```

This will return the newly created client together with a secret. Please copy the secret to a secure place. You won't be able to retrieve it later.

:::danger Take care

This client has a secret which needs to be protected. Never use this client or its secret with Frontend applications like Native, Hybrid or Web Apps.

:::

## Retrieve an Access Token

Once the client has been created, you can call the `/token` endpoint to get an Access Token.

You can use our [Wemogy.Identity.AspNetCore NuGet package](https://github.com/wemogy/identity/packages/674418) in your ASP.NET Core projects, to get an Access Token to call another API.

```bash
dotnet add package Wemogy.Identity.AspNetCore
```

Register the `TokenService` globally as a singleton.

```csharp title="Startup.cs"
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	services.AddSingleton<ITokenService>(new TokenService("<PUBLIC_ENDPOINT>", "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>", "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>", "<YOUR_SCOPE>", "<YOUR_CLIENT_AUDIENCE>"));
}
```

Now you can use the built-in Dependency Injection to retrieve the `ITokenService` in your Controllers or Services and get a Token for your requests.

```csharp title="DemoController.cs"
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class DemoController : ControllerBase
{
	readonly ITokenService _tokenService;

	public DemoController(ITokenService tokenService)
	{
		_tokenService = tokenService;
	}

	[HttpGet]
	public async Task Test()
	{
		var token = await _tokenService.GetTokenAsync();

		// ...
	}
}
```
